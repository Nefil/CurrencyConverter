# CurrencyConverter

## Project Description

CurrencyConverter is a desktop WPF application written in C#. The application retrieves current currency exchange rates from an external API (the API key shown in the code is for demonstration only) and lets you convert amounts between selected currencies. Exchange rates are stored locally in a SQLite database using Entity Framework Core so the app can use the latest saved rates when offline.

The project demonstrates use of WPF for the UI, HttpClient for network requests, JSON parsing for API responses, LINQ for data handling, and Entity Framework Core for database operations.

## Features

- Fetch current currency exchange rates from an external API (example: openexchangerates.org)
- Convert amounts between selected currencies
- Simple WPF graphical user interface
- Input validation and basic error handling (network errors, invalid input)
- JSON parsing of API responses
- Currency rate data model and local persistence in SQLite
- Automatic update of rates on startup (if network is available)
- Project includes a test project with unit tests

## Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- WPF
- HttpClient
- Newtonsoft.Json
- LINQ
- Entity Framework Core (SQLite)

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nefil/CurrencyConverter.git
   ```
2. Open the solution (CurrencyConverter.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Obtain an API key from a currency rates provider (e.g. https://openexchangerates.org/) and set it in the code or configuration (the repository currently shows a demo placement for the key).
4. Restore NuGet packages, build the solution and run the application.

## Usage Example

- Start the application.
- Select the source and target currencies in the UI.
- Enter the amount to convert and click "Convert".
- If connected, the app will fetch the latest rates, save them to the local SQLite database, and display the converted result.

## Configuration

- The API endpoint and API key are defined in the source code — consider moving them to a configuration file or environment variables for production use.
- The SQLite database file is created and managed by Entity Framework Core — check the project configuration for the database path/name.

## Tests

- The repository contains a test project with unit tests covering the conversion logic and other components.
